### About this Brief 
For this brief we worked with the current UX students at Hyper Island to develop a solution to effectively communicate the Ricola Sustainability Footsteps towards current employees in a way that was interactive and not overwhelming. 

We created 'Ricola World', a web application that a user can interact with to get levels of the information. First level communicates the categories (x4), and then once interacting with that category they then get the footsteps within. These footsteps are initially condensed to a overview, but once interacting with the card are presented with the full information. This was our way of preventing information overload while still making the content available.
